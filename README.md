# Lights Out Game
 
I wanted to create some toys for Christmas. I had this game as a kid and spent way too much time trying to complete the levels.

I made this with html, css, JavaScript, and jQuery. The layout changes responively to suite the aspect ratio of the screen and the cursor should change according to what things do. I played a  bit with flexbox. 

You can see the result here https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/pen/wpGQOZ.

## Learnings and next ups
- Make a very precise wire-frame of what you want at the different sizes and aspect ratios. THis will make things easier. 
- I want to get more comfortable with flexbox, maybe CSS grid. I think this could have saved some challenges. 
- Potentially animation when pushing a button
- Winning "light-cycle" animation instead was not optional. Something to show that you've won before redrawing was needed.
- Could be fun to re-skin as an apartment building.
